[Important Note] 
The original creator of this Datapack is PhoenixSC. He made the datpack for Minecraft Version 1.14.4. Because Mojang keeps adding new blocks and this
is a really cool datapack, I (Louis9) decided to keep updating it. If PhoenixSC has a problem with me reuploading his datapack in newer Versions,
I'm gonna take it down as soon as I can, but I hope this Version is allowed, because I have made many people happy with it. But again, if there
are any Problems, I will take it down. You can find his original Video with the datapack here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kFPn0BBYY&ab_channel=PhoenixSC
