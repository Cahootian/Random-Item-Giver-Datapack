[Original Creator] 
The original creator of this Datapack is Phoenix SC. Back in 2019, he made the datpack for Version 1.14.4. Because of newer items added by recent version as 
well as compatibility issues, and also because I really enjoy this datapack, I (Louis9) decided to keep updating it. I asked Phoenix SC for permission and he 
allowed me to continue development. If PhoenixSC has a problem with me developing and publishing his datapack for newer versions, let me know and I'm gonna 
take it down as soon as I can. You can find his original video for the datapack here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kFPn0BBYY&ab_channel=PhoenixSC
