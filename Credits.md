The Random Item Giver Datapack was originally created by Phoenix SC. He is creating awesome datapacks and youtube videos, so go check him out.
This datapack is a continuation of his datapack, hosted and maintained by me, Seeloewen aka Louis9. With his permission, I'm updating it to every major version of Minecraft and also some snapshots.
